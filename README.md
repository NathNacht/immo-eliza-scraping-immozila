##  Description
This Python project employs web scraping techniques to compile a dataset of real estate properties in Belgium. Specifically, we utilized Immoweb to gather information on 10,000 houses and apartments available for sale across the country.

<ul>Property ID</ul>
<ul>Locality name</ul>
<ul>Postal code</ul>
<ul>Price</ul>
<ul>Type of property (house or apartment)</ul>
<ul>Subtype of property (bungalow, chalet, mansion, ...)</ul>
<ul>Type of sale (note: exclude life sales)</ul>
<ul>Number of rooms</ul>
<ul>Living area (area in m²)</ul>
<ul>Equipped kitchen (0/1)</ul>
<ul>Furnished (0/1)</ul>
<ul>Open fire (0/1)</ul>
<ul>Terrace (area in m² or null if no terrace)</ul>
<ul>Garden (area in m² or null if no garden)</ul>
<ul>Surface of good</ul>
<ul>Number of facades</ul>
